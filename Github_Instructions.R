# 1. edit code
# 2. save
# 3. click git dropdown, select commit
# 4. select files to commit to "new-branch" repo, add comments to designate changes
# 5. CLose commit window
# 6. Open git shell in more drop down
# 7. Type in "git push origin new-branch", assuming new-branch is the name of you branched repo
# 8. go to github online and make a new pull request, merging data from new-branch into the master repo JSATS_Filtering....

# Figure out if I have a local copy of new branch
# I don't think that there is a local copy of the branch it is just a temporary branch to write and edit code without
# fucking everything up.  You can delete the branch each time after the merge is completed.
